# katanamrp Task:
=================

Framework and Approach:
I have used BDD cucumber with page object model. In which features file is placed inside the Feature and UI folder and step definition and pages are placed inside
step Definitions and pages respectively.

How to Run :
=============
1) Install all dependencies with node js (npm i)
2) Run in headless mode with Tags (./node_modules/.bin/cypress-tags run -e TAGS='@UI')

Feel free to ask me if any question.
Thanks
